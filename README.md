# Teacher-StudentSharingPlatform

I developed a project in Istanbul Esenyurt University with Asp.Net and MSSQL
technologies. Thanks to this project, teachers will be able to message their students.
Students will be able to message among themselves. Teachers will be able to share
documents about the course with their students. Teachers will be able to make
announcements about the course. Students will be able to follow all their grades
through this website. Students will be able to access statistics showing their success.
There is an Admin, Student and Teacher panel. Thanks to this application, you can use
Dropbox and Whatsapp features in one application. Also universities, highschools and
primary school can use this website. I will continue add new features for this website.
